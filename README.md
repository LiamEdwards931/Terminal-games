# User experience

- With the project terminal games, I am trying to envoke a positive user experience by giving them a simple landing page in which they can easily access the games they wish to play, by simply pressing the number for the game they want to play they can enjoy the game for example in battleships once this game is over, they can easily go back to the landing page to select another game if they wish too or from here they can simply exit the program

# Features

# Future Features
- With the way that I have set the landing page up for terminal games, the future features will be to implement more games that can be easily accessed through the options on the run file.

# BUGS 
- Bug where if user types "no" to exit the game it repeatedly asks without breaking the loop. - fixed this by rather than calling the function in the main home screen, importing it when a user selects to play the game in the terminal games home screen as this was causing the game to continuously loop.

- Bug where if user entered empty field it would cause an error - fixed this by wrapping the inputs and main game loop in a while loop looking for a correct validation

# Commits 
- Several large commits whilst fixing issues, as I was deleting or rearranging a lot of code to try to get the code running the way that I needed it too.
I didn't commit the changes as I was doing it as the code wasn't behaving in the way that I was expecting it too and wished to commit only when it was working.
