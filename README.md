# User experience

- With the project terminal games, I am trying to envoke a positive user experience by giving them a simple landing page in which they can easily access the games they wish to play, by simply pressing the number for the game they want to play they can enjoy the game for example in battleships once this game is over, they can easily go back to the landing page to select another game if they wish too or from here they can simply exit the program.

- With the battleships game I wanted to create 2 boards so you could keep track of your own guesses but also to see where the computer was hitting too, to make the game feel a little bit more authentic.

# Features

# Future Features
- With the way that I have set the landing page up for terminal games, the future features will be to implement more games that can be easily accessed through the options on the run file.

# Testing

- I have tested the terminal games project by: 
    - Running the game and checking each input works as it should.
    - Checking different possibilities in the input field to check my validation is working correctly.
    - Ran and completed the battleship game to ensure that the home screen is working again
    - This also included checking you can re-enter the game after it had been reset. 
    - Took the code line by line to check for any whitespace, indentation issues.
    - Played the game where the computer wins to ensure that it is registering correctly. 
    - Tested the visuals and breaks in the lines to give readability.


## BUGS 
- Bug where if user types "no" to exit the game it repeatedly asks without breaking the loop. - fixed by calling the import at the top and the function with the option with the correct syntax. "battleships.battleships()"

- Bug where if user entered empty field it would cause an error - fixed this by wrapping the inputs and main game loop in a while loop looking for a correct validation

# Commits 
- Several large commits whilst fixing issues, as I was deleting or rearranging a lot of code to try to get the code running the way that I needed it too.
I didn't commit the changes as I was doing it as the code wasn't behaving in the way that I was expecting it too and wished to commit only when it was working.
